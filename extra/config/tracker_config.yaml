# Tracker settings (currently using simple CentroidTracker)

# Maximum distance (pixels) between detections & tracks
max_track_distance: 80      # Reduced for stricter matching

# Maximum frames a track can remain unassigned before removal
max_lost_frames: 5          # Reduced to remove fleeting false positives faster

# Minimum detection confidence to track an object
min_detection_confidence: 0.70  # Increased to match model_config

# Minimum age (frames) before a track is considered confirmed/stable
# Helps filter out single-frame false positives
min_confirmed_age: 8        # Only show objects tracked for 8+ frames (more stable)

# If later replacing with ByteTrack or DeepSORT, use these settings:
bytetrack:
  track_thresh: 0.5
  high_thresh: 0.6
  match_thresh: 0.8

deepsort:
  max_cosine_distance: 0.2
  nn_budget: 100
  max_iou_distance: 0.7
