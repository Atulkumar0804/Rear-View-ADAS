# Camera intrinsic parameters
fx: 1000        # focal length x (pixels)
fy: 1000        # focal length y (pixels)
cx: 640         # principal point x (pixels)
cy: 360         # principal point y (pixels)

# Camera mounting configuration
mounting_height: 1.0        # meters (distance from camera lens center to ground)
pitch_deg: 8.0              # downward tilt of camera (positive = pointing down)

# Notes:
# - Replace fx, fy, cx, cy after performing camera calibration.
# - mounting_height should be measured with a tape scale.
# - pitch_deg can be estimated manually or from IMU.
